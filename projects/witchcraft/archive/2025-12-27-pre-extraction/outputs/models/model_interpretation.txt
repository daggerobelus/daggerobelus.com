LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL INTERPRETATION
Lorraine Witchcraft Trials - Accusation Prediction
======================================================================

1. ACCUSATION MODEL SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Sample Size: 7380 individuals
Accused: 313 (4.2%)
Cross-validated AUC: 0.913 (+/- 0.035)

2. KEY PREDICTORS OF ACCUSATION
----------------------------------------
  - clustering_coefficient: OR=6.427 (increases accusation risk by 543%)
  - brokerage_score: OR=4.102 (increases accusation risk by 310%)
  - degree: OR=2.431 (increases accusation risk by 143%)
  - betweenness_centrality: OR=0.504 (decreases accusation risk by 50%)
  - pagerank: OR=1.229 (increases accusation risk by 23%)

3. INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------------
  * Gender has modest effect on accusation risk
  * Central network positions appear protective
  * More connections correlate with higher accusation risk

4. CAVEATS
----------------------------------------
  * Network position may reflect accusation rather than predict it
  * Historical data has inherent selection biases
  * Model assumes linear effects in log-odds
