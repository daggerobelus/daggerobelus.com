Notable features: prior legal attempts to seek reparation for being called witch; consultation of multiple diviners/healers by victims; withdrawal of accomplice accusations at execution; emotional context of son's death in war preceding devil's seduction. Rich detail on material culture (food, magical objects, money) and economic tensions. 16 witnesses provided detailed testimony linking quarrels to specific harms with temporal sequences.",
