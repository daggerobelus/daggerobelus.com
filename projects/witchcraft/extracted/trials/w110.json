    "notes": "This is a particularly significant case as Jennon Petit Didier was RELEASED after torture, which is rare in the Lorraine trials. Notable features: (1) Extensive family history of witchcraft execution (father, grandfather, sister, brother and nephew all accused/executed); (2) She fled and remained hidden for months before being found; (3) She had an illegitimate child which made her economically vulnerable; (4) Multiple employer disputes and economic conflicts; (5) Withstood torture without confessing; (6) Released with no costs charged to her. The case shows the power of reputation by family association, economic precarity of single women servants, and the rare circumstance where denial under torture led to release. Key mystery: who fathered her child (claimed Claudot Gillotte le jeune, whose wife was witness #2 - adding layer of social tension). The trial lasted 113 days with months spent searching for her. Costs of 171 francs were paid at Mirecourt in December 1618, though she was not charged.",
