(6) Economic tensions prominent - lost jobs, reciprocal service disputes, poverty as motivation. (7) Pattern of animal deaths (especially horses) following quarrels. (8) Reputation ranging from 3-20 years among witnesses. (9) No tears during confrontation noted as 'sign of sorcerer'. (10) Detailed confession of weather magic and crop damage. Costs: 55 francs for preliminary enquiries (joint with Margueritte Francois).",
