The case was triggered by accusations from recently executed witches (Engel and Christienne de Bidestroff). Notable features include: (1) weak witness testimony - most witnesses knew nothing against her or only recent rumor; (2) economic distress as trigger for alleged devil pact (19 franc debt); (3) interesting sabbat narrative with invocation of Jesus causing disruption; (4) confession expanded under torture; (5) relatively rapid timeline from arrest to execution (29 days); (6) Rémy (the famous witch-hunter and author of Daemonolatreiae) was the prosecutor. The case illustrates the chain-reaction nature of witch trials, with accusations from executed witches triggering new arrests.",
