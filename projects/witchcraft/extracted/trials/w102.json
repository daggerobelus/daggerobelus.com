The trial record is detailed with 15 witnesses, comprehensive documentation of the torture sessions, and critical marginal notes indicating that the court at Dieuze exceeded its legal authority by repeating torture. The Change de Nancy intervened to stop illegal practices and ordered her release. The case reveals economic and social tensions around her work as a herdsman, class differences (her lack of property vs. husband's property), and prior expulsions from multiple communities. Her resistance under torture and refusal to confess falsely ('could not damn her soul') is notable. The critical legal annotations provide rare documentation of oversight mechanisms and limits on torture.",
