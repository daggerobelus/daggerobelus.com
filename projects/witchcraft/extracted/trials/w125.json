Multiple themes: economic disputes (cow, flour, taxes), healing/cursing duality, expelled from previous village. Devil named Percin, described as cold as marble with talons and calf feet. Confession includes classic elements: seduction, sabbat, sexual relations with devil, making weather. Notable that she refused devil's counsel to do infinite evil. Jeannotte's age approximately 70, mentioned being 15 during Brandenburg War (guerre de Brandebourg).",
