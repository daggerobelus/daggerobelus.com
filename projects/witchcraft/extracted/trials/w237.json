The trial resulted in conflicting recommendations: Rémy wanted whipping and monastery placement, while the Change de Nancy recommended death. Ultimately the Duke showed mercy and the boy was released after 2+ years in custody. The case provides rich detail about children's experiences of poverty, labor, and the sabbat narrative. The judges challenged the truthfulness of the confession ('fables et mensonges'). Notable for extended custody period, ducal intervention, and ultimate release - very rare outcome. Trial documents span from June 1606 to November 1608.",
