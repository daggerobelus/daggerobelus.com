    "notes": "This is a remarkably detailed trial record with extensive witness testimony. Key observations: (1) Alizon was 99 years old - extraordinarily old for the period, which influenced torture restrictions. (2) She had been previously imprisoned 12 years earlier on witchcraft charges from same witness (Colin Coural) but was released after he paid costs - highly unusual. (3) Strong evidence of healing practice - multiple witnesses sought remedies from her and were cured, including specific herbal/folk remedies documented. (4) Pattern of 'bread and salt cure' appears in multiple testimonies - obtaining bread and salt from her house and consuming for 9 days was standard counter-magic. (5) She never confessed despite two torture sessions, remained defiant throughout using blasphemous language. (6) Change de Nancy intervened multiple times, eventually ordering release despite Rémy (famous witch-hunter) requesting banishment. (7) Touch healing pattern clear - she touched/shook victims who then recovered. (8) Market competition prominent - several quarrels over selling fruit/bread. (9) Religious incident with communion host suggests suspicion from clergy. (10) Spider familiar mentioned in one testimony. Age stated as 99 may be approximate or exaggerated.",
