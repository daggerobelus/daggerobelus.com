The document states there were 18 witnesses and Marion did not reproach any of them, but their names and specific testimonies are not included in this PDF. Economic status assessed as 'destitute' based on property worth of just over 19 francs and her statement about having no means of support. Healing practices are well-documented including use of white stone for diagnosis, herbal remedies, and divination rituals. Change de Nancy was consulted twice: first approving torture (14 July), then calling for further torture (21 July), and finally approving death sentence (27 July). The relationship between Marion and the devil is notably characterized as reciprocal obedience 'moyennant les linceux' (by means of shrouds). Marion's sexual history from age 15 and having 5 children by various men (all deceased) indicates extreme social marginalization. Age is approximate ('might be 60'). The trial shows clear progression from initial denial, to confession after threat of torture, to expanded confession under actual torture.",
