    "property_disputes": true,
    "details": "Husband Nicolas Humbert owed money to Guillaume Tarrat for at least 16 years; Tarrat summoned him before maire to get payment. Dispute over fruit rights in garden led to conflict. Husband frequented taverns in Sainte Croix where he would spend up to 2 days, suggesting some disposable income but also marital stress. Accused's economic status appears poor based on: (1) prolonged unpaid debt, (2) husband's tavern habits leaving her alone, (3) no mention of property ownership, (4) seduction narrative mentions devil promised money, suggesting need."

(3) No information about Change de Nancy consultation - appears to be local court decision only. (4) The term 'etique' for child's illness likely refers to wasting disease/consumption. (5) 'soubs ladite assuée' is unclear terminology - may refer to specific condition or curse. (6) Two witnesses (5 and 7) both mention Jeanne femme Joliat's death, providing corroboration. (7) Torture method not specified beyond standard procedure. (8) No execution date given, only sentence date. (9) Grand Rombach vs Grand Romberg appears to be spelling variation of same place.",
