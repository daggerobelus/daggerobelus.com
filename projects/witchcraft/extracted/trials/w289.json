    "notes": "This trial shows a woman with a long-standing reputation (12+ years) who was finally brought to trial. Key uncertainties: (1) The exact relationship between Claude Colin Mengeon (witness 4) and the accused is complex - he mentions 'her husband's son Claudon Mengin' suggesting he may be related through remarriage. (2) The identity of 'Bon Didier' as accomplice may be an alias. (3) Economic status assessed as 'poor' based on: only had one cow whose milk was for daughter, cow seized and could not recover it, desperate economic circumstances precipitating alleged pact. (4) Confession came after preparation for torture and brief racking - judges noted she was on point of confession before torture. (5) Multiple prior accusations but never acted on until this trial. (6) Strong pattern of harms following quarrels or legal disputes. (7) Accused showed hesitation about naming wife of Mengeon Masson, expressing desire not to accuse wrongly. (8) Notable that several witnesses were family members or close neighbors with complex relationships.",
