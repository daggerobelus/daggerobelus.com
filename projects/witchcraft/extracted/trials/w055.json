Trial shows pattern of accusations following economic disputes (debts, mortmain, property), threats and quarrels followed by livestock deaths and human illnesses/deaths. Accused initially denied all charges, confessed after confrontations and under torture, retracted confessions, then renewed them under torture. Executed with enhanced punishment for killing her own son. Notable for detailed accounts of healing activities that were later reinterpreted as evidence of causing the original harm. Extensive detail on daily life, economic relationships, and community dynamics. Reputation spans 10-20 years according to various witnesses. La Rebaynne appears to be a nickname for the accused.",
