    "notes": "This is a detailed trial with 25 witnesses and extensive documentation. Key uncertainties: (1) The exact date of confrontations is marked as '? October 1604' in source - could be late October based on surrounding dates. (2) Economic status assessed as 'poor' based on: served as domestic, had bastard daughter, lacked money for wedding feast, multiple debts, lived 'as honestly as she could', people she owed prevented eviction, husband left due to 'meschantes langues' rather than providing for family. However, she also had some income (sold grain, people owed her money, provided lodging). (3) Practiced healing assessed as TRUE based on: gave 'chandelle beniste, bread and salt' to la musniere as healing charm; gave 'bretzelle' to cure Marguerite Winssart; advised 'barbontine' drink for sick child; confession about wanting to heal Wiriat child but accomplices refused; Jean Gaulthier recovered after obtaining 'three substances from her house'. Category: charms_amulets. (4) Change de Nancy ruling: Initially prescribed strangling after feeling fire (22 Nov), but final sentence was burning alive (10 Dec) - local court did NOT follow appellate court's more lenient modification. (5) Formal accuser: Set to null as this was not a partie formelle case but rather informations preparatoires initiated by authorities based on accumulated reputation and prior accusations. (6) Multiple accomplices named under torture but most accusations retracted or modified in subsequent interrogations - Barbelline explicitly stated she confessed more than she committed due to torture and learned sabbat details from other trials. (7) The trial shows significant legal complexity with multiple retractions, renewed confessions under threat of torture, and ultimate execution despite Change de Nancy's modification prescribing a more merciful death.",
