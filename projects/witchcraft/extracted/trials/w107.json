She used powder on their own horse which died despite trying to cure it. Persin told her not to confess, said he'd bear pain, had been in throat but left when she drank holy water. Admitted killing Fleuratte femme Jean de Glonville because she had palliage where women spun and wouldn't make place for her - threw black powder on her while sitting on cairalle Sunday afternoon. Made cousin Nicolas Hanry's wife ill then cured her because children called her witch. Attended sabbat but didn't dance because lame - others called her Beccesse and langarde, said she'd cause them to be discovered. At sabbat: great devil on horse received adoration, told them to take vengeance. Dancing around table with bagpipe/cornemuse, then banquet without bread/wine/salt, mostly beef, thrown piece separately. All wore masks resembling muzzles, hers was leather. Master brought mask, took it after sabbat. Transported in cloud/fog embraced by master, arrived quickly. Devils valued rich over poor, beautiful over ugly."

Confession obtained under torture (rack) after withstanding thumbscrews. Named accomplices but later retracted charges against husband. Change de Nancy approved both torture and death sentence. Many witnesses reported only reputation. Economic context shows poverty, disputes over animals, ploughing arrangements, and inheritance. Mother Laurence previously imprisoned for witchcraft. Testimony summaries condensed due to volume; some details of specific quarrels and circumstances abbreviated for length constraints.",
