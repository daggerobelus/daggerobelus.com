The document notes she was 'fugitive from St Dié for that reason' suggesting prior accusations there. Economic hardship is evident: husband worked in mines and gave her nothing; she sold eggs for income (healing services). She practiced healing (cured le Gros Claude by having him buy and eat her eggs). Temporal note: seduction occurred 14-15 years before 1561 (c.1546-1547); hailstorm 12-13 years before (c.1548-1549). Possible name variants: Blaise Laneçon vs Blaise Lanceon vs Colin Lanceon - may be same family or transcription variants. Thursday evening sabbats are notable timing detail.",
