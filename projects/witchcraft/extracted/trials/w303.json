(2) Some accomplices named at sabbat may correspond to other trials but trial_id connections not established. (3) The exact nature of the 'faux serment' (false oath) that Jean accused Noel Roch of is unclear. (4) Economic status assessed as 'poor' based on: occupation as swineherd (low-status work), devil's promise of money 'so he would never want' suggesting poverty, payment disputes, and concern for 'dearth and the poor'. (5) Some victim names in harms_catalog are generic (e.g., 'young man guarding animals') because specific names were not provided in confession. (6) Witness number 0 used for harms mentioned in accused's confession rather than witness testimony. (7) The trial shows Jean Colin was confronted with Jennon femme Demenge le Maire's accusation of seeing him at sabbat, which triggered his voluntary confession - this is noted as prior accusation. (8) First wife's execution as witch mentioned but no trial_id available. (9) Court officials' names not given in this document extract. (10) No explicit torture used - confession was voluntary after confrontation.",
