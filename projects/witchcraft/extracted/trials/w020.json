    "notes": "This is an extraordinary case of a 12-year-old boy with severe facial disfigurement (bitten as infant) requiring an interpreter. No witnesses testified; the trial consists entirely of Jean's confessions about attending sabbat with his mother (witch 18). He provided extremely detailed descriptions of sabbat rituals including black mass parody. His mother had already been tried (w018). The case involved confrontations where both Jean and his mother maintained accusations despite denials. No evidence of torture. Final outcome unclear from document. Cross-reference with w018 (mother Mengeotte) essential for full understanding.",
