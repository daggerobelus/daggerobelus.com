Babon confessed to seduction during extreme poverty and multiple maleficia over 20+ years involving conspiracies with previously executed witch Chrestaille. The case involves complex debt relationships, inheritance disputes, and social tensions between rich and poor (evident in sabbat hailmaking testimony). Rémy's request for additional witnesses reveals prosecutorial concern about insufficient maleficia given the timespan. The confession includes vivid sensory details about intercourse with devil ('cold as marble'). Two separate Nicolas/Colas Harmant deaths are described - both involving horse deaths followed by human death. Trial moved quickly from voluntary confession to execution in 34 days.",
