Claudin escaped on 26 July 1586 after confessing under torture. Ambroise was banished for life on 1 September 1586 after withstanding torture twice without confessing. The trial provides rich detail on quarrels, maleficia, social relationships, legal procedures, defense strategies, and the dynamics between the accused. Notable features include Claudin's elaborate biographical account, Ambroise's steadfast resistance to torture, the escape inquiry, and extensive reproaches against witnesses.",
