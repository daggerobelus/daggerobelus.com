He never confessed despite multiple torture sessions including thumbscrews, rack, and tortillons. His mother was executed as witch ca. 1592. Very detailed trial record with 38 witnesses. Notable for Claude's effective defense strategy, ability to provide alternative explanations, and remarkable resistance to torture. Significant evidence of his refusal to seek legal redress when called witch, which was used against him. Economic tensions around wine trading and horse dealing feature prominently. Case shows importance of social and economic disputes in accusations. Document also includes brief notation about second trial in 1621 where he was again released after torture and inspection of scars.",
