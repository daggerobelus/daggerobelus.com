Uncertainty: The names Jean Curty (husband of witness 1) and Claude Curty (mentioned in confession) may be the same person or related - the text uses both names for 'portier' role. The term 'troutieres jeunes filles' is unclear - may be a location descriptor or occupation. Devil's name 'Creusson' recorded. Accused showed unusual healing practice (white powder to cure). Economic hardship evident throughout. Notable that Change de Nancy required verification of harms before approving death sentence.",
