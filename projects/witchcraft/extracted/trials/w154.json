Notable detail about seeking to escape devil through pilgrimage to Saint Claude de Coniche. Jean Gomel/Goniel spelling varies (also 'serorge' which may be uncle/relative). Witness 6 is duplicate of witness 2 (both Jean Didier le Marchal, 50, Bertrimoutier) testifying to oak tree story. Economic status assessed as 'middling' based on: laboureur occupation, owned house with cellar, had garden, owned multiple animals (cat, horses, etc.), resided 30 years, but also experienced animal losses suggesting not wealthy.",
