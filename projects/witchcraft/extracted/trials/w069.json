Barbe initially confessed voluntarily, then attempted to retract, then confessed more extensively under torture. She attempted suicide in prison. Many of her confessed malefices followed a pattern of economic desperation - refusals of charity triggering revenge. The record shows tension between her claims she harmed no one and extensive confessions to multiple murders and malefices. She retracted one accusation against an accomplice, admitting it was false to speed proceedings. The case demonstrates the role of poverty, reputation, public naming as witch, and the escalation of confessions under interrogation and torture.",
