Some confusion around exact wording of Chrestaille's quote to Jeanne Claudin - two versions provided. Document dated from deposition on 6 April 1597 for witness 8 appears to be out of chronological sequence. Methods of torture not specified beyond 'question ordinaire et extraordinaire'. Chrestaille confessed to pact with devil named Mre Hanry, attending sabbats, and causing multiple deaths and illnesses through use of magical wand and yellow powder.",
