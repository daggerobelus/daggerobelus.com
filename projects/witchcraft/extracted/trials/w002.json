The accused was a village herdsman whose loss of this position and related economic disputes drove most of the conflicts. The trial shows the legal process backfiring - Mengin sought redress for defamation but the accused chose to become partie formelle, leading to full witchcraft prosecution. Confession came only under torture and included standard elements: devil pact, powders, sabbat attendance. Named one accomplice at execution. Clear economic tensions around customary payments and herdsman position. Total of 20 witnesses with varying levels of specific testimony (some reputation only). Trial lasted 23 days from informations preparatoires to execution.",
