Ydatte Moyne was a 68-year-old widow who had been widowed twice and spent her final years as a beggar. Her confessions were extensive and voluntary - torture was approved but not used because the executioner deemed her too feeble. The trial shows a clear pattern of alleged maleficia related to disputes over alms and resources, reflecting the economic vulnerability of an elderly beggar woman. She was denounced by Jehenne (Jehenne Medecin) and confessed immediately, naming 8 accomplices seen at sabbat. The trial moved quickly from arrest to execution (15 days). Notable aspects include: (1) economic context of begging and disputes over alms; (2) confession without torture; (3) marginal note warning not to interrogate Olry Go's wife despite Ydatte naming her; (4) extensive catalog of maleficia spanning years; (5) her statement that she killed so many people she couldn't remember them all due to old age.",
