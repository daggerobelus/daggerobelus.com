Thomasse was accused primarily in her role as paistre (herder) of horses, and many disputes centered on her occupational responsibilities. She maintained firm denials even under torture. The trial ended with renvoy jusqu'a rappel (released subject to recall) rather than death or explicit banishment, though PG des Vosges had requested 10-year banishment. She was denounced again in 1620 and had apparently fled. Notable features: strong defense with counter-accusations of theft and fraud against witnesses; unusual healing episode with chambriere; economic context of military troubles; brother-in-law as witness against her.",
