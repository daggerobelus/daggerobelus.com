Jean initially confessed voluntarily after being unable to bear the ceps, then retracted, then confirmed under torture. He eventually withdrew his accusations of accomplices at confrontation, calling himself a liar and perjurer. The case shows classic patterns: economic disputes, reputation built over years, prior accusations, detailed maleficia catalog, and escalating confessions under torture. Jean's poverty and marginal status as shoemaker appear central to conflicts. Notable is his claim that sabbat was 'all illusion' and that witches often think they're there but don't leave the house.",
