The trial record focuses heavily on the interrogations under torture and the confession. Catherine consistently denied causing any harm even under extreme torture (thumbscrews, rack, tortillons, strappado). She confessed to renouncing God and meeting the devil but expressed immediate remorse. She initially named two accomplices under torture but withdrew these accusations the next day. The Change de Nancy intervened to request further interrogation due to gaps in confession and to restrict torture practices. Notable that she threw away the powder given by the devil and resisted sexual advances. Economic hardship is evident (loss of money, needing small sum for bread, sharing one bed). The case shows typical witchcraft trial pattern: quarrel -> harm -> accusation, with multiple alleged victims being children of those who quarreled with or accused her.",
