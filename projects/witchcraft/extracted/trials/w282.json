    "notes": "Trial has clear documentation with 11 witnesses and detailed confession. Key uncertainties: (1) The exact relationship between Jean des Boeufs (witness 2) and Fleuratte is unclear - same surname suggests possible family relation but not stated. (2) The term 'apparois' appears to be a property boundary or passage between houses but exact meaning uncertain. (3) Witness 10 (Magdelaine) provided no specific harms but confirmed reputation and told of incident where Fleuratte seemed to have fit 5 years earlier. (4) Economic status assessed as 'poor' based on: being in great want at time of seduction, envy over others' earnings, husband earning less than neighbors, sitting at table with poor at sabbat, devil's comment about not wanting to kill husband because it would leave family in poverty. (5) Practiced_healing set to true based on: advised Catherine to rub child with water, advised Georgeatte to rub son with brandy and rosewater, obtained healing powder from master, knew Catherine's milk had returned without being told - suggests cunning knowledge. (6) No torture used - confession was voluntary after initial denial. (7) Timeline shows very rapid trial: Nov 3 informations, Nov 9 interrogation with denial, Nov 10 voluntary confession, Nov 16 approval, Nov 17 execution - only 14 days total. (8) Sabbat confession reveals interesting class dynamics: rich and poor sat at separate tables with different levels of respect; comment about rich not wanting to aid poor in context of hailstorm. (9) Devil's name 'Mre Navel' is unusual. (10) Confession mentions devil wanted her to kill her husband 'a cause qu'il luy estoit rude' (because he was rough/harsh with her) but she refused fearing poverty.",
