    "confidence": "high",
    "notes": "This is an exceptionally detailed voluntary confession case with significant research value. KEY FEATURES: (1) VOLUNTARY CONFESSION: Annon appeared before judges at her own request to make full confession - extremely rare. She was already in prison because Demenge Polier had constituted himself partie civile, claiming she had long been reputed a witch. (2) MATERNAL INHERITANCE: Her mother Jehenne was previously executed for witchcraft, establishing intergenerational pattern. (3) ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AS SEDUCTION TRIGGER: The seduction occurred when upset about husband selling their house in faubourg - she feared he would spend money instead of turning it to profit. This economic anxiety was the emotional state when devil appeared. (4) POVERTY INDICATORS: Could not afford meat from butcher (leading to his death); had many children to provide for; Nicolas de Leusse had taken one of her children into his house (suggesting she couldn't support all); sent child to sister expecting help but they gave nothing; killed own pig 'so that they should be thought subject to misfortunes like others' (awareness of community suspicion). (5) MORAL AGENCY: She refused multiple times to kill people the devil suggested (husband, neighbor's wife, Nicolas de Leusse) and gave specific moral reasons based on family obligations and past kindness. This shows complex moral reasoning within the confession framework. (6) HEALING/CURING: She expressed pity and CURED some victims (Gabriel Mercier, Toussaint Piernille Charier); intended to cure Mongeon Failley but was arrested before she could. This suggests she saw herself as having healing powers, not just harming. Schema field 'practiced_healing' set to true with 'other' type. (7) EXPERIMENTAL MALEFICE: First two acts (wife of Jean Bietrix, cow) were explicitly 'to try powder' with 'deliberate will' but 'no hatred or enmity' - testing the powder's efficacy. (8) SABBAT NEGOTIATION: Only attended sabbat once, saw no one (all masked), then negotiated annual payment of hen to avoid future attendance - suggests some agency in relationship with devil. (9) BEATEN BY MASTER: Was beaten for refusing to kill - shows coercion within the diabolical pact. (10) RAPID TRIAL: Only 10 days from arrest (Oct 30) to execution (Nov 9). No torture used - confession was voluntary. (11) COSTS: 74 francs total, half falling on duchy. (12) TIMING: Arrest on Friday before All Saints (Oct 30, 1615) prevented her from curing the butcher who died same day - shows importance of timing in narrative. (13) WITNESSES: All 5 witnesses confirmed their harms, making this a well-corroborated case. (14) DYSENTERY OUTBREAK: Recent dysentery outbreak mentioned as context for one harm - shows epidemic disease context. (15) SOCIAL SLIGHTS: Multiple harms triggered by social slights (not invited to baptism, asked to move at veillée, sister gave nothing) showing importance of honor/inclusion. (16) VEILLÉE: Social gathering mentioned - important for understanding community social structures. (17) AIDES TAXATION: Wife of Demenge Lucas complained about overtaxation of aides - shows tax collection as source of conflict. (18) UNCERTAINTY RE CLAUDATTE'S CHILD: Confession says 'petit fils' (grandson) but witness testimony suggests it might be her son; I've recorded as son based on witness testimony saying 'small son' but noted the discrepancy. This could be translation/transcription issue or Claudatte was caring for grandson. Left as 'small son' in harms catalog to match witness testimony.",
