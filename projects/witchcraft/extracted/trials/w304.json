Accused made voluntary confession on Dec 14, retracted it on Dec 24 saying it was false and taken from other trials she heard, then renewed confession with more specific details during same interrogation. No torture mentioned despite retraction and renewal. Multiple deaths confessed including several children, suggesting accused may have been trying to explain child mortality in community. Change de Nancy approved death sentence. Some uncertainty: timeline shows witnesses on Dec 10 and 14/16, but Change approval dated Dec 12 (possibly out of order in document or approval was for procedure). Economic status assessed as 'poor' based on: seeking alms, disputes over very small amounts (1 sol), husband's drinking debts, and pattern of being refused basic goods (milk) by community members.",
