Margueritte was a widow and beggar who had been feared as a witch for 20+ years. Notable features: extensive catalog of harms including human deaths, animal deaths, and unusual afflictions (e.g., shape-shifting beasts); confession obtained under torture about seduction by devil named Persy following child's drowning; powder given at sabbat; refused to name accomplices despite repeated torture. Some name variations (Cugnin/Cuinin, Bujieux/Puysieux/Puzieux, Mongenot/Mengenot, Margueritte Poirson) noted. Rich economic context of begging, debt disputes, and refusals of charity.",
