The accused was a herdsman whose occupation gave him access to many animals that subsequently died or became ill. Notable features: (1) Clear pattern of quarrel-threat-harm sequence documented by multiple witnesses; (2) Accused's habitual swearing 'par la mort dieu' noted by multiple witnesses; (3) Voluntary confession before torture, but torture still applied; (4) Economic desperation prominent - poverty, debts, disputes over small sums; (5) Confession narrative fits standard template, with transcriber's note that 'record sounds suspiciously as if answers were suggested to him'; (6) Accused named three accomplices at sabbat; (7) Prior accusation by Ydatte Vaultrin who claimed to see him at sabbat; (8) Detailed predictions by accused about animal deaths that reportedly came true; (9) All harms are to animals (no human deaths), primarily cattle; (10) Prosecutor was Rémy (likely Nicolas Rémy, famous witch-hunter and author of Daemonolatreiae).",
