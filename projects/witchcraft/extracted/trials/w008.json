Very detailed testimony with extensive witness statements, confession under torture, and multiple procedural stages. Notable elements include: family history of witchcraft (grandmother burned, father and sister reputed), black dog familiar incident, son-in-law repeatedly calling her witch, supernatural strength (righting cart), sleep-talking incidents, multiple harm allegations, and confession to attending sabbat while avoiding sexual relations with devil. Confession obtained only after second torture session. The trial shows classic patterns of reputation evidence, quarrel-harm sequences, and torture-induced confession.",
