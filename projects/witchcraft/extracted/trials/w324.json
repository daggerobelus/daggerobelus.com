    "notes": "This is a confession-based trial with no witness testimony recorded in the document. The trial moved very quickly from interrogation (Aug 7) to death sentence (Aug 29). Jacqueline confessed voluntarily without torture, including detailed accounts of sabbat attendance and bewitchment. Notable that she: 1) admitted both harming and healing the same victim, 2) practiced divination/cunning folk practices using napkin measuring and saint invocations, 3) repeatedly opposed crop damage at sabbat (claiming poor people didn't want to agree), 4) continued religious practices (holy water) despite devil's opposition, 5) threw away remaining powder in river. Her poverty after first husband's execution (by hanging) is central to the seduction narrative. The formal accuser Didiere called her 'sorciere et double sorciere'. C.M. Rémy (Nicolas Rémy, author of Daemonolatreiae) was the prosecutor. Change de Nancy approved the death sentence without modification. Document does not specify execution method but given standard practice and approval process, likely strangulation then burning.",
