Key uncertainties: (1) Exact timing of some harms is relative rather than absolute; (2) Some witness testimony is hearsay rather than firsthand observation; (3) Economic status assessed as 'poor' based on work as seamstress taking in boarders/students, debt disputes over small amounts (10 francs), and business competition over sewing work - she appears to have been struggling economically; (4) Practiced_healing set to false - no evidence of healing practice, only harmful magic; (5) The sister-in-law mentioned by Gerard Codat appears to be the same Demenge Mathiatte's wife mentioned in the confession, though the relationship is described differently (sister-in-law vs. wife of Demenge Mathiatte); (6) Trial costs of 42 francs shared between duke and abbot of Meyenmoutier; (7) No information about whether torture was approved or used - confession appears voluntary; (8) Some victims mentioned in confession (Catherine Curiels, clerc jure, Francoise Brabant) were not part of initial witness testimony but were confessed to by accused.",
