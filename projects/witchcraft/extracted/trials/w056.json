Claudette was an itinerant healer/diviner who practiced 'white magic' healing but confessed under pressure to devil's pact and sabbat attendance spanning 30 years. Notable for: 1) her resistance to devil at first meeting, 2) her ambivalence about harming people (often repented and healed them), 3) complex relationship with fellow beggar Jeandon whom she falsely accused then exonerated before execution, 4) economic desperation as context for devil's seduction, 5) rich detail about popular healing practices (pilgrimages, prayers, material remedies), 6) extensive maleficia catalog spanning decades and locations. Trial costs: 51 francs 8 gros. Sentence: death by strangulation after feeling the fire. Jeandon Bassat was arrested based on her accusations but released ('renvoyé jusques à rappel') after she retracted under torture and to Carmelite confessor.",
