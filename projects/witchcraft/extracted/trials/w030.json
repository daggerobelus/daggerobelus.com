    "notes": "This is a notable case of acquittal/release. The accused had a reputation from childhood (allegedly saying as a child he could make hail), which led to confirmation at abbey rather than rebaptism. Evidence was very thin - mostly hearsay about childhood remarks, with only circumstantial harm allegations (horse deaths after quarrels). The accused showed emotional vulnerability during interrogation, crying when discussing parents and denying charges. The Change de Nancy recognized the weak evidence and recommended release despite the procureur fiscal's request for torture. The judge's comment about not inferring guilt from parental witchcraft is particularly notable. This case demonstrates that not all trials ended in execution, especially when evidence was primarily based on childhood rumors and circumstantial animal deaths.",
