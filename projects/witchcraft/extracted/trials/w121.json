    "notes": "This trial is exceptional for revealing judicial corruption and false accusations. Nicolas Fontaine was pressured by local officials at Einville to accuse wealthy people ('gens de moyens, opulentz, et riches'). The marginal note 'abus en l'exercice de la justice' (abuse in the exercise of justice) is a rare acknowledgment of procedural misconduct. Rémy intervened to release all falsely accused and required Nicolas to publicly declare their innocence before execution. The case provides detailed geographic mobility of an itinerant shepherd over 20 years and economic grievances (unpaid debts, refusal of credit, dismissal from service) as motives for both malefice confessions and false accusations. No witness testimony recorded - case based entirely on confession. Victim names sometimes inconsistent (Marie vs Agnes Petit for prévôt's wife; Joannes de Dieuze vs Joannes Messager).",
