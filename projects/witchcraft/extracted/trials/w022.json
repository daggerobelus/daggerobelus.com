Grevillon was primarily a traveling peddler-healer who claimed to use small demonic familiars (kept in boxes) to advise him on remedies and business dealings. Key features: (1) No accusations of maleficia in traditional sense - he was a healer, not accused of harming; (2) Extensive testimony about magical healing practices, fern seed collection ritual, urine diagnosis; (3) His familiar spirits were described as fly-sized creatures in boxes that he bought, sold, and fed; (4) Initially retracted confession claiming drunkenness; (5) Under torture made limited confessions about demon teaching remedies; (6) Pricking test essentially negative (surgeon found no true insensible mark); (7) No sabbat attendance, no renunciation of God confessed even under torture; (8) Death sentence based on legal theory that using familiars requires pact with devil; (9) Rich material culture evidence of early modern healing practices; (10) Case involves cross-regional networks (Burgundy, Lorraine, Allemaigne). Trial lasted 79 days, cost 107 francs. This trial is particularly valuable for understanding the fuzzy boundary between acceptable folk healing and prosecutable magic in 17th century Lorraine.",
