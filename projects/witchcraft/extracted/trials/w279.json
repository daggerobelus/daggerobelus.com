    "notes": "This is a highly unusual trial where the accused was released after resisting torture. Epnon maintained consistent denials throughout, agreeing to circumstantial details while denying key accusations. The Change de Nancy intervened twice: first approving torture, then blocking further torture and ordering her release unless more evidence was produced. Notable features: (1) Epnon was extremely poor (destitute) and relied on begging - could hardly see, owned only part of house; (2) Multiple witnesses used counter-magic, seeking items from her house to cure afflictions, suggesting belief she could both cause and cure; (3) She never confessed to a demonic pact despite torture; (4) Her story about being raped 30 years earlier by Vincent du Foire appears to be an attempt to explain away the devil seduction narrative without admitting to witchcraft - she insisted he was a normal man; (5) Strong evidence of economic tensions - she was repeatedly refused charity (milk, food, clothes) and was owed 100 francs from a prior legal case that she never received; (6) Witness 10 (Bastien Jean Chesne) was her son-in-law who lived with her and testified about thunderstorm incident and her reputation; (7) The cunning woman of Souche gave explicit counter-magic advice that relied on Epnon providing the cure herself - if suspected witch came offering food, accept and eat it because it would help; (8) Son of Epnon (by second husband) accused his own mother of going to sabbat by the 'cramet' (cauldron); (9) Document notes this was an 'unusually consistent case' in terms of her sensible denials; (10) C.M. Remy (author of Demonolatry) was the procureur general who requested torture.",
