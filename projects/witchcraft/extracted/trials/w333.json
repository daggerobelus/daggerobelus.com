Strong evidence of family/kinship networks involved (sisters-in-law relationship between accused and witnesses 1 and 8). Economic disputes prominent: legal costs, unpaid lodging, animal losses with stated economic value (100 francs). Confession extracted under repeated torture (racked multiple times). Retraction influenced by fellow accused (la Grande Barbelline). Notable that husband tried to restrain Jeanne during threat to lodger. References to healing through religious offerings (St Genais) by victims. Some uncertainty about relationship between Nicolas Jean Jacob (witness 5) and Colas Jean Jacob (victim in confession) - possibly same person or related. Identity of 'la Joliatte' unclear but appears central to Jeanne's stated hatred of Colas Jean Jacob. The phrase 'belle beste' appears to be an insult/sarcastic term.",
