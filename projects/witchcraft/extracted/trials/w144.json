Zabel maintained innocence until torture, then confessed. Trial shows clear poverty and social marginalization of accused. Multiple references to her daughters being involved in foraging disputes. Notable defense claim about being confirmed in church and therefore unable to be witch. Prior accusation by 'la Pelisonnatte' (executed at St. Dié) was withdrawn but still influenced community perception. Economic desperation led to illicit relationship with maire that produced child.",
