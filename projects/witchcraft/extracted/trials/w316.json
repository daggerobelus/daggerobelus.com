    "notes": "This is an unusual case - not a typical witch trial leading to execution, but rather a trial focused on unauthorized healing practices using garter divination. The accused was released after Change de Nancy ruled evidence insufficient. Key uncertainties: (1) The exact relationship between François Picquot and François le Clerc - text suggests they may be the same person or Claudon remarried, but '11 and a half years' marriage to Picquot and 12 years since first husband's death suggests François Picquot is her second husband, possibly also known as François le Clerc. (2) Several place names are uncertain (Loupole, Vielle marked with '?' in source). (3) The trial reveals extensive evidence of Claudon's healing practice network - she made pilgrimages for at least 4 named clients and was consulted by many of the witnesses. (4) Most testimony is ambivalent - witnesses heard she was a witch but saw no harm, or consulted her for healing but it failed. (5) The formal accuser, Demenge Olry, was himself imprisoned for witchcraft and named Claudon at the end of his own trial. (6) Economic status assessed as 'poor' based on: need to take payment for healing work, worked as servant in youth, no property mentioned, required to pay trial costs which suggests modest means but not destitute.",
