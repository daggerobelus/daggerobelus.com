Multiple economic disputes (debts, property damage, theft) preceded witchcraft accusations. Strong pattern of quarrel-threat-harm sequence. Notable that Odile's mother was previously executed as a witch. Odile moved from Fribourg to Assenoncourt 5 years before trial, possibly to escape growing reputation. Trial shows typical progression: reputation evidence, specific maleficia allegations (mostly animal deaths, some human illness/death), denial, torture, confession to sabbat attendance and deliberate maleficia, death sentence. Confession includes classic elements: devil seduction with false money, cold sexual intercourse, renunciation of God, sabbat attendance with dancing/feasting, flying to sabbat on fork, weather magic frustrated by church bells, making poisonous powders from children's bodies, naming accomplices. Gender dynamics noted in Odile's statement that 'woman is not master' regarding seeking legal redress.",
