The trial shows classic patterns: long-standing reputation (14 years), quarrels over small economic matters followed by harm, community fear leading to appeasement with gifts of food. She initially confessed to encounter with devil but later retracted; confession was renewed under torture. She was executed by burning on November 10, 1615. The case led to investigation of Curien Simonin whom she named under torture. Notable for detailed healing practices mixing Catholic and folk elements, and extensive catalog of alleged maleficia including human deaths, animal deaths, and illnesses.",
