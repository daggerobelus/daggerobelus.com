Ottile consistently retracted confessions when not under torture. Notable legal procedural issue: death sentence not read before second torture, requiring court authorization for third session. Trial reveals network of three women (Ottile, Lutschen Meyete, Margueritte la Porchiere) accused together. Economic tensions evident in dispute over cow sale. Prison conditions described as extremely cold. Evidence includes testimony about noises/voices in prison suggesting possible demonic visitation or hallucination. Total trial duration 83 days from arrest to execution. Costs initially assessed at 212 francs, later reduced to 175 francs by Chambre des Comptes in May 1622.",
