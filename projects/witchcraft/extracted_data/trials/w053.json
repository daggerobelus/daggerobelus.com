Trial shows classic pattern: long-standing reputation (up to 20 years), multiple quarrels over economic disputes (animals, shoes, grain carting), alleged harms following quarrels, torture leading to confession, naming of accomplices later retracted. Notably, Febuay retracted his accusations of accomplices, saying he named them 'out of hatred.' The trial involved extensive animal-related harms (horses, sheep, calf, foal) indicating the economic importance of livestock. Touch and proximity were alleged methods. One witness (Humbert Charier) claimed Febuay both caused and cured his illness through touch. Brother-in-law testified against him (Nicolas Crousier, witness 16). Febuay was originally from Gondrexon where he was already suspected in his youth.",
