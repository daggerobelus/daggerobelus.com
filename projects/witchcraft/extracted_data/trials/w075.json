The Change de Nancy's decision to release her (renvoyée) rather than follow PG des Vosges' recommendation for flogging and banishment is significant - they ruled she had 'sufficiently purged the accusations.' Physical evidence of torture resistance documented (bleeding from hands and feet). Notable absence of confession despite torture.",
