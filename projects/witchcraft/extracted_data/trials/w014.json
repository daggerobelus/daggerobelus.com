The case is notable for: (1) three family members accused together (husband, wife, and wife's sister); (2) multi-generational witch reputation (grandmother died in prison at Arches, mother suspected); (3) extensive evidence based on failure to seek legal redress for defamation; (4) only the two sisters were executed - Claude was not; (5) confessions obtained only under torture; (6) 50-year reputation span mentioned; (7) pattern of quarrel-threat-harm across multiple witnesses; (8) animals as primary targets of alleged maleficia; (9) torture confessions naming multiple accomplices; (10) imprisonment conditions explicitly noted due to age and winter season. The outcome indicates Claude was released while his wife and sister-in-law were executed.",
