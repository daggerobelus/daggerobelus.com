Final outcome: Change de Nancy recommended banishment without confiscation, but local bons hommes jugeants sentenced to death by burning; Prévôt persuaded them to allow strangling first. Trial shows classic pattern of accumulated reputation, economic conflicts, and pressure from executed witches' accusations. Petroniere maintained some level of denial throughout despite torture, never provided detailed sabbat descriptions or named accomplices despite repeated questioning. Jeandon (previously executed witch) appears as key third party who identified her to multiple witnesses. Counter-magic with bread, salt, and ashes from her house features prominently in multiple testimonies.",
