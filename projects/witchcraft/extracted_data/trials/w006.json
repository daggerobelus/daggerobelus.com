Trial shows pattern of reputation evidence, multiple quarrel-harm sequences, marital conflict (husband suspected and beat her), prior accusations from executed witches, confession under torture with devil pact narrative, and naming of accomplices. Notable elements include accused's habitual speech pattern of giving soul to devil, husband's suspicion and surveillance, economic disputes (debts, property), and detailed harm catalog spanning human deaths (especially children), animal deaths, and illnesses. Torture progression from thumbscrews to rack produced increasingly detailed confession. Death sentence approved by Change de Nancy with addition of strangling.",
