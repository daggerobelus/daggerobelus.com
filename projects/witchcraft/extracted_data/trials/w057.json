    "notes": "This is an extraordinarily complex family trial involving 9 accused family members. The case centers on the testimony of 9-year-old Mongeotte who accused her entire extended family of attending sabbat. Key features: (1) Multiple accused from same family (grandparents, parents, uncles, aunt, cousin); (2) Child witness as primary accuser; (3) Torture used extensively to extract confessions; (4) Multiple retractions and renewals of confessions; (5) Cross-accusations from other trials (Colatte, George d'Avouzey); (6) Complex family dynamics and quarrels; (7) Economic context of poverty and debt; (8) Mixed outcomes: 4 executed (Rollat, Jannon, George, Margo, Demenge), 2 released pending recall (Marion, Jean), 2 children punished but not executed (Mongeotte returned to mother, Georgel whipped); (9) Detailed confessions about sabbat, devil appearances, powder, and maleficia; (10) Significant property confiscation. Trial shows judicial process with appeals to Change de Nancy. Notable that judges seemed sympathetic to Marion from the start ('modestie fort honneste') and she was not tortured as severely. The prévôt feared the accused would kill Mongeotte as key witness.",
