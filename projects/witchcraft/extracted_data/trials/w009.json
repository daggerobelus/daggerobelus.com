Notable for the sheer volume of alleged harms (primarily animal deaths following quarrels), the accused's repeated claim she lacked means to pursue legal redress when publicly defamed, and the role of the procureur d'office (Sr. Handel) whose own cow had allegedly been killed by the accused. Catherine maintained innocence under extreme torture until losing consciousness, then confessed 2 hours later. Trial shows classic malefice pattern: quarrel/refusal followed by harm. Economic tensions evident throughout. Judges noted discrepancy between Catherine's claimed age (70) and appearance (under 50, 'forte et robuste').",
