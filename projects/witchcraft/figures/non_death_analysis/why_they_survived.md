# Why They Survived: Analysis of Non-Death Sentence Cases in Lorraine Witchcraft Trials

## Executive Summary

Of 347 witchcraft trials in this corpus, **312 (89.9%) resulted in death sentences**. This analysis examines the 35 cases (10.1%) that did not end in execution, seeking to identify the distinguishing factors that allowed these accused to escape the stake.

**Key Finding**: The single most important factor was **resistance to torture without confession**. Statistical analysis reveals that "confess" (p=0.0044) and "sabbat" (p=0.0005) terms appear significantly less frequently in non-death cases. The accused who survived were those who endured the rack, thumbscrews, and tortillons without admitting to diabolical pacts or sabbat attendance.

| Released (*renvoyé jusqu'à rappel*) | 9 | 2.6% |
| Banished | 9 | 2.6% |
| Unknown/Incomplete | 17 | 4.9% |

## The Five Factors of Survival

### 1. RESISTANCE TO TORTURE (Primary Factor)

The Lorraine legal system required confession for execution. Without confession, even overwhelming community testimony was insufficient. The critical moment was the *question ordinaire et extraordinaire* - judicial torture.

**Statistical Evidence**:
- Mean "confess" mentions: Death cases = 1.13, Released = 0.78, Banished = 0.11
- Mean "sabbat" mentions: Death cases = 1.58, Released = 0.33, Banished = 0.00
- Mann-Whitney U test: Both differences statistically significant (p < 0.01)

**Case Examples**:

**Gillette Page (w090)** - Aged 70, widow:
> "Given thumbscrews, rack, and tortillons, but **firmly denied everything** alleged against her."

Despite 20+ years of reputation and 20 witnesses, she was released because she confessed nothing.

**Epnon Charbonatte (w279)** - Aged ~60, widow:
> "Given thumbscrews, then racked (noted that she **endured much pain, but was resolute**). Questioned repeatedly about episode with stranger; she declared... it had been a normal man like her husband. **Denied any pact or malefice.**"

The Change de Nancy ruled for release despite the Procureur General requesting further torture.

**Claudate George (w064)** - Aged 66:
> "Given thumbscrews on hands and racked. Called on Jesus, Virgin, and various saints for aid, but **confessed nothing**. Torture obviously unusually short; she was released in consideration of her 'debilité et son vieil age'."

### 2. ABSENCE OF SABBAT CONFESSION

The sabbat confession was the lynchpin of execution. Confessing to sabbat attendance implicated the accused in collective diabolical conspiracy and typically led to naming of accomplices.

**Statistical Finding**: Sabbat mentions are essentially **zero** in banished cases (mean = 0.00) vs. 1.58 in death cases.

**Contrast - Death Case (w014, Mengeotte Hocquart)**:
> "Mengeotte withstood thumbscrews, and first stage on rack, but then asked to be released, and **began to confess**. Seduced by devil 5 or 6 years before. Agreed that she had **been to Sabbat, 5 or 6 times**. List of those she had seen there: Jeannon femme de Colin Blaise, Collatte sa fille..."
>
> Result: **Death sentence** (16 December 1617)

This confession transformed a survivable case into a capital one. Her brother-in-law Claude, who was NOT tortured because the women did not accuse him, was released.

---

### 3. ADVANCED AGE / PHYSICAL FRAILTY

Courts showed some consideration for the elderly, particularly in moderating torture:

| Case | Age | Outcome | Note |
|------|-----|---------|------|
| w118 Catherine Claude | 82 | Banished 10 years | Oldest in corpus |
| w090 Gillette Page | 70 | Released | "moderation suitable to her age" |
| w064 Claudate George | 66 | Died in prison | Torture shortened due to "debilité et son vieil age" |
| w279 Epnon Charbonatte | ~60 | Released | "poor widow who could hardly see" |

However, age alone was not protective. The corpus contains numerous executions of elderly accused who confessed under torture. Age operated primarily by **limiting the severity of torture**, which increased chances of maintaining denial.

---

### 4. EXCEPTIONAL POSITIVE CHARACTER TESTIMONY

In rare cases, overwhelming positive testimony could outweigh suspicion.

**Mathieu Blaise (w141)** - The most remarkable acquittal in the corpus:

Of 37 witnesses, nearly all testified **positively** for the accused:

> Witness 1: "had never seen any harm in him"
> Witness 3: "always heard him reputed 'homme de bien'"
> Witness 6: "in his service he had been 'bien payé et content'"
> Witness 7: "had seen nothing in him but 'toutes choses bonnes'"
> Witness 9: "Knew him to be of 'telle bonne volonté' that if any 'homme de bien' had business with him he would help him from his own goods"
> Witness 12: "Thought accusations did him great wrong, and that 's'il estoit tel ne se fauldroit asseurer à personne'"

The Change de Nancy ruled that "precipitamment il a esté apprehendé" (he was precipitously arrested) and ordered immediate release. **Nicolas Remy himself** (the famous demonologist) concurred.

Key factors in Mathieu's case:
- Male accused (men were ~20% of Lorraine accused)
- Former community official (tax collector, maire)
- Rumor traced to a single prior case that "ne se trouva" (was not proven)
- No torture required due to favorable testimony

---

### 5. PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES / WEAK ACCUSATIONS

Some cases collapsed due to problems with the accusation itself.

**Catherine Claude (w118)** - The schoolmaster who regretted:

The *partie formelle* (formal accuser) Jean Magnien was himself imprisoned alongside the accused when he revealed he had been **bribed** by the maire:

> "maire said he would cover his costs, even if these amounted to a hundred florins, and promised to give him an overcoat for his trouble"

Magnien later testified:
> "For his part knew she was suspected, but **had never seen her commit any act of witchcraft, and repented having accused her**."

The maire had been "trying to persuade Jean Pateltangel to become partie formelle, promising him 6 gros for every inhabitant."

Though Catherine was ultimately banished (for folk healing, not witchcraft), the case exposes how accusations could be manufactured.

## Comparative Statistical Analysis

### Term Frequency Comparison

| Term | Death (n=312) | Released (n=9) | Banished (n=9) |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| reputation | 9.38 | 9.00 | 8.00 |
| confess | **1.13** | 0.78 | **0.11** |
| sabbat | **1.58** | 0.33 | **0.00** |
| torture | 2.13 | 2.89 | 1.22 |
| quarrel | 2.09 | 2.44 | 1.22 |

**Key observation**: Reputation levels were similar across outcomes (no significant difference, p=0.97). The differentiator was **what happened after arrest**, not the strength of pre-existing suspicion.

### Statistical Significance Tests

| Term | Mann-Whitney U | p-value | Significant |
|------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| confess | 3868.0 | **0.0044** | Yes |
| sabbat | 4088.0 | **0.0005** | Yes |
| torture | 3283.5 | 0.2177 | No |
| reputation | 2821.5 | 0.9736 | No |
| quarrel | 2661.5 | 0.7041 | No |

## The Legal Mechanism: *Renvoyé jusqu'à rappel*

Most released cases received the verdict "*renvoyé jusqu'à rappel*" (released subject to recall). This was not an acquittal but a suspension - the accused could be re-arrested if new evidence emerged. It represented the court's acknowledgment that suspicion existed but legal proof was insufficient.

**Epnon Charbonatte (w279)**:
> "14 July 1615; procureur general asks for further torture, but Change de Nancy rules that she should be **renvoyée jusqu'à rappel**, unless he produces further evidence against her"
>
> "16 July 1615; note that she has been released **with warning about future conduct**."

---

## The Role of the Change de Nancy

The *Change de Nancy* (appellate court) repeatedly **overruled** local prosecutors who demanded execution or further torture:

- **w090**: PG asked for banishment, Change ordered release
- **w141**: Change declared arrest "precipitous," ordered release
- **w279**: PG asked for more torture, Change ordered release
- **w064**: PG asked for banishment, Change ordered release (accused died in prison before implementation)

This suggests that central judicial oversight provided some check on local persecution, though the 89.9% execution rate indicates this check was rarely exercised.

---

## Banishment vs. Release

Banished cases (n=9) differed from released cases (n=9) in one key respect: **admitted practices**.

**Catherine Claude (w118)** was banished for 10 years specifically for:
> "d'avoir usé de plusieurs sortz, charmes, prestigistions, et aultres moyens ilicites et prohibez de droict pour descouvrir les especes de maladies"
>
> (having used various spells, charms, prestidigitations, and other illicit means prohibited by law to discover types of illnesses)

She openly described her folk healing practices (using prayers, a scarf for divination, treating animal illnesses). The court convicted her of **superstition and imposture** rather than diabolical witchcraft.

This represents a crucial legal distinction: practicing unsanctioned healing merited banishment; confessing to sabbat attendance merited death.

## Conclusions

### Why 89.9% Died

The Lorraine witch trial system was designed to produce confessions and executions:
1. Pre-existing reputation (often decades long) established suspicion
2. Quarrel-threat-misfortune pattern provided trigger
3. Community testimony provided legal basis for arrest
4. Torture extracted confessions
5. Sabbat confessions implicated others, creating chain reactions

### Why 10.1% Survived

The survivors broke this chain at step 4:
1. **They did not confess under torture**
2. Without sabbat confession, the case lacked diabolical element
3. The Change de Nancy required proof beyond reputation
4. *Renvoyé jusqu'à rappel* allowed release without acquittal

### The Lottery of Survival

Survival depended on:
- Physical and psychological capacity to resist torture
- Age that might moderate torture severity
- Luck of accusation circumstances (weak partie formelle, etc.)
- Occasional favorable testimony

What survival did **not** depend on:
- Duration of reputation (similar across outcomes)
- Number of witnesses (similar across outcomes)
- Type of alleged harm (similar patterns)

The difference between life and death in Lorraine witchcraft trials was ultimately the difference between confession and denial under torture. The 18 survivors (released + banished) were those whose bodies or circumstances allowed them to endure without speaking the fatal words.
